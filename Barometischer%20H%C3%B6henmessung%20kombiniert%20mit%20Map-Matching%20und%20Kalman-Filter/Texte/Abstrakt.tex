\textbf{
In this paper a location estimation algorithm is briefly presented - especially focused on the vertical position. The idea is based on the combination of a Map-Matching algorithm and a Kalman Filter. Both are implemented in a altimeter, which consists out of a GPS shield and a sensor. While the GPS is giving the x,y and z coordinates as well as the velocity, the sensor can measure the temperature, pressure and the altitude over mean sea level (MSL) by using the so called international height formulae (or another one). The goal of this paper is to introduce some basic knowledge and to give a short answer on to the question: How can the vehicleâ€™s positioning be improved?
